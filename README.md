# PIP_Everything
This is an attempt to develop a python script to download all the PyPi pacakges for python listed in [(pypi index)](https://pypi.python.org/simple/). This is done by parsing the website and then send a os.system command to pip install the package, packages which have already been installed will be upgraded.
